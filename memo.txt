IaaS vs PaaS vs SaaS vs On-Premise
IaaS: cloud-based services, pay-as-you-go for services such as storage, networking, and virtualization.
PaaS: hardware and software tools available over the internet.
SaaS: software that’s available via a third-party over the internet.
On-premise: software that’s installed in the same building as your business.


1. IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service).
-IaaS businesses offer services such as pay-as-you-go storage, networking, and virtualization.
-IaaS gives users cloud-based alternatives to on-premise infrastructure, so businesses can avoid investing in expensive on-site resources.

IaaS Delivery:
Over the internet.

IaaS Advantages:
-Maintaining on-premise IT infrastructure is costly and labor-intensive.
-IaaS solutions are highly flexible and highly scalable, and you can replace it whenever you need without losing money on your initial investment.

IaaS Characteristics:
-Highly flexible and highly scalable.
-Accessible by multiple users.
-Cost-effective.


2. PaaS (Platform as a Service).
A PaaS vendor provides hardware and software tools over the internet, and people use these tools to develop applications. PaaS users tend to be developers.

PaaS Delivery:
Over the internet.

PaaS Advantages:
-PaaS is primarily used by developers who are building software or applications.
-PaaS allows the developer to focus on the creative side of app development, as opposed to menial tasks such as managing software updates or security patches. 
-Any platform updates, security patches and general maintenance to their store would be the responsibility of the merchant.

PaaS Characteristics:
-Accessible by multiple users.
-Scalable – you can choose from various tiers of resources to suit the size of your business.

Most SaaS providers operate a subscription model with a fixed, inclusive monthly account fee.

SaaS Delivery:
Over the internet.

SaaS Advantages:
-With SaaS, you don’t need to install and run software applications on your computer (or any computer).
-You can usually access the software from any device, anytime (as long as there is an internet connection).
-You no longer need to engage an IT specialist to download the software onto multiple computers throughout your office or worry about keeping the software on every computer up-to-date.

SaaS Characteristics:
-Available over the internet.
-Hosted on a remote server by a third-party provider.

Serverless computing: 
  -cloud computing model in which the cloud provider allocates machine resources ON DEMAND, taking care of the servers on behalf of their customers. 
  -Pricing is based on the actual amount of resources consumed by an application.[1] It can be a form of utility computing. 
  -"Serverless" is a misnomer in the sense that servers are still used by cloud service providers to execute code for developers. 
  -However developers of serverless applications are not concerned with capacity planning, configuration, management, maintenance, operating or scaling of containers, VMs, or physical servers.
  -Developer don't have to care about their infrastructure thingy.
