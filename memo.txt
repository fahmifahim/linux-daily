IaaS vs PaaS vs SaaS vs On-Premise
IaaS: cloud-based services, pay-as-you-go for services such as storage, networking, and virtualization.
PaaS: hardware and software tools available over the internet.
SaaS: software that’s available via a third-party over the internet.
On-premise: software that’s installed in the same building as your business.
