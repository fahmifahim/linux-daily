★IaaS vs PaaS vs SaaS vs On-Premise
IaaS: cloud-based services, pay-as-you-go for services such as storage, networking, and virtualization.
PaaS: hardware and software tools available over the internet.
SaaS: software that’s available via a third-party over the internet.
On-premise: software that’s installed in the same building as your business.

★1. IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service).
-IaaS businesses offer services such as pay-as-you-go storage, networking, and virtualization.
-IaaS gives users cloud-based alternatives to on-premise infrastructure, so businesses can avoid investing in expensive on-site resources.
-IaaS cover the Hardware, Network, OS layer

IaaS Delivery:
Over the internet.

IaaS Advantages:
-Maintaining on-premise IT infrastructure is costly and labor-intensive.
-IaaS solutions are highly flexible and highly scalable, and you can replace it whenever you need without losing money on your initial investment.

IaaS Characteristics:
-Highly flexible and highly scalable.
-Accessible by multiple users.
-Cost-effective.


★2. PaaS (Platform as a Service).
-A PaaS vendor provides hardware and software tools over the internet, and people use these tools to develop applications. PaaS users tend to be developers.
-PaaS cover the Hardware, Network, OS, Middleware layer

PaaS Delivery:
Over the internet.

PaaS Advantages:
-PaaS is primarily used by developers who are building software or applications.
-PaaS allows the developer to focus on the creative side of app development, as opposed to menial tasks such as managing software updates or security patches. 
-Any platform updates, security patches and general maintenance to their store would be the responsibility of the merchant.

PaaS Characteristics:
-Accessible by multiple users.
-Scalable – you can choose from various tiers of resources to suit the size of your business.
-Built on virtualization technology.
-Easy to run without extensive system administration knowledge.


★3. SaaS (Software as a Service).
SaaS platforms make software available to users over the internet, usually for a monthly subscription fee.
Most SaaS providers operate a subscription model with a fixed, inclusive monthly account fee.
-SaaS cover the layer of Hardware, Network, OS, Middleware, Application layer

SaaS Delivery:
Over the internet.

SaaS Advantages:
-With SaaS, you don’t need to install and run software applications on your computer (or any computer).
-You can usually access the software from any device, anytime (as long as there is an internet connection).
-You no longer need to engage an IT specialist to download the software onto multiple computers throughout your office or worry about keeping the software on every computer up-to-date.

SaaS Characteristics:
-Available over the internet.
-Hosted on a remote server by a third-party provider.
-Scalable, with different tiers for small, medium, and enterprise-level businesses.
-Inclusive, offering security, compliance, and maintenance as part of the cost.

★Google Cloud: 
- GCE (Google Cloud Engine)
    . Live Migration
- GKE (Google Kubernetes Enginer)
- GAE (Google App Engine)


★What is Serverless computing? 
  -cloud computing model in which the cloud provider allocates machine resources ON DEMAND, taking care of the servers on behalf of their customers. 
  -Client/Business Owner/Developer don't have to care about their infrastructure things (ignore the server, serverless). 
  -Pricing is based on the actual amount of resources consumed by an application.
  -"Serverless" is a misnomer in the sense that servers are still used by cloud service providers to execute code for developers. 
  -However developers of serverless applications are not concerned with capacity planning, configuration, management, maintenance, operating or scaling of containers, VMs, or physical servers.

★What is Agile, CI/CD and DevOps? How they differ?
Agile: 
-focus on PROCESS
-highlighting CHANGE
-emphasize DELIVERY ACCELERATION 

CI/CD: 
-focus on SOFTWARE-DEFINED LIFECYLE
-highlighting TOOLS
-emphasize AUTOMATION 

DevOps:
-focus on CULTURE
-highlighting ROLE 
-emphasize RESPONSIVENESS


★★Network
★What is different between TCP/UDP
TCP: 
  -Transfer Control Protocol
  -信頼性の高い通信（3 way handshake: SYN -> SYN/ACK -> ACK）
  -Connection型：通信状況を確立しながら、データ転送
  -転送速度が低い
  -用途：Web閲覧、メール送受信、ファイル転送
  -デメリット：メモリ/CPUを消費する

UDP:
  -User Datagram Protocol
  -信頼性低い
  -Connectionless型：通信状況を確認せず、データ転送（push）
  -転送速度が早い
  -用途：動画ストリーミング、broadcast
  -デメリット：パケットロスが発生しうる

★HTTP Status code
  1xx informational response – the request was received, continuing process
  2xx successful – the request was successfully received, understood, and accepted
  3xx redirection – further action needs to be taken in order to complete the request
  4xx client error – the request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled
  5xx server error – the server failed to fulfil an apparently valid request
