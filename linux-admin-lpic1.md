#### # 101.2 Boot the system
Weight: 3

*Description:* Candidates should be able to guide the system through the booting process.

*Key Knowledge Areas:*
- Provide common commands to the boot loader and options to the kernel at boot time.
- Demonstrate knowledge of the boot sequence from BIOS/UEFI to boot completion.
- Understanding of SysVinit and systemd.
- Awareness of Upstart.
- Check boot events in the log files.

The following is a partial list of the used files, terms and utilities:
- dmesg
- journalctl
- BIOS
- UEFI
- bootloader
- kernel
- initramfs
- init
- SysVinit
- systemd

### # Boot Linux System
#### 1. BIOS
- BIOS is Basic Input Output System and does the first steps of the PC bootup. For example is does a POST (Power On Self Test) and decides which hardware should boot the system.
- PowerON --> BIOS --> Recognize HDD and decide the device priority by order. 
- On each device: read the MBR (Master Boot Record) located on head sector. Bootloader is then executed.
- Device priority can be set manually on BIOS display. 
- Currently, other than BIOS, UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) is recently developed and widely being used in the modern system. 

#### 2. bootloader
<p>Bootloader can be GRUB (1&2) or LILO which are great for disks less than 2TB.</p>

```bash
/etc/lilo.conf
/boot/grub/grub.cfg
/boot/grub/menu.lst
```

#### 3. Kernel
- Kernel parameters (sometimes called boot parameters) supply the kernel with information about hardware parameters that it might not determine on its own - say single user mod boot (S)
- Recognize and control hardware; then, performs various initialization processes such as mounting root file system.
- Kernel image, kernel version is located on /boot directory. 
- Start the /sbin/init

#### 4. init
- When the kernel finishes loading, it usually starts /sbin/init. This program remains running until the system is shutdown. 
- It is always assigned PID 1 for init process.
- In SysVinit system, /sbin/init is started during the initial process. Autostart application is executed by order as recorded in the `/etc/inittab`. 
- In recent/modern system (like `systemd`), /etc/inittab is no more used.  

#### dmesg
- Funny fact: During the bootup, only The Kernel is running so it should record and keep its own logs!
- dmesg command will show the full data from kernel ring buffer up to now. 
```bash
# Print or control the kernel ring buffer
$ dmesg
$ journalctl -k
$ journalctl --dmesg
[996822.568071] userif-3: sent link down event.
[996822.568078] userif-3: sent link up event.
[996823.415945] wlp16s0: authenticate with 50:c4:dd:3b:8d:08

# Clear the dmesg log
$ dmesg --clear

```

#### /var/log/messages
- After the init process comes up, syslog daemon will log messages. It has timestamps and will persist during restarts.
- Kernel is still logging its own messages in dmesg.

#### initramfs
- The only purpose of an initramfs is to mount the root filesystem. The initramfs is a complete set of directories that you would find on a normal root filesystem. It is bundled into a single cpio archive and compressed with one of several compression algorithms.
- At boot time, the boot loader loads the kernel and the initramfs image into memory and starts the kernel. The kernel checks for the presence of the initramfs and, if found, mounts it as / and runs /init. The init program is typically a shell script. Note that the boot process takes longer, possibly significantly longer, if an initramfs is used.
- It is located on /boot directory

#### # journalctl
- journalctl config file: /etc/systemd/journald.conf
```bash
# Check log based on unit
$ journalctl -u systemd-resolved.service
$ journalctl -u 'systemd*'
$ journalctl -u '*docker*'

# Specify time using --since(-S) and --until(-U)
$ journalctl --since today
$ journalctl -S "2020-01-01 11:00:00" -U "2020-01-02 12:00:00"

# Specify the Priority

#### # 102.1 Design hard disk layout

Weight: 2

*Description:* Candidates should be able to design a disk partitioning scheme for a Linux system.

Key Knowledge Areas:
- Allocate filesystems and swap space to separate partitions or disks.
- Tailor the design to the intended use of the system.
- Ensure the /boot partition conforms to the hardware architecture requirements for booting.
- Knowledge of basic features of LVM.

The following is a partial list of the used files, terms and utilities:
- / (root) filesystem
- /var filesystem
- /home filesystem
- /boot filesystem
- EFI System Partition (ESP)
- swap space
- mount points
- partitions

#### # Hard Disk Design
- Physical Volume (pv): a whole drive or a partition. It is better to define partitions and not use whole disks - unpartitioned.
- Volume Groups (vg): this is the collection of one or more pvs. OS will see the vg as one big disk. PVs in one vg, can have different sizes or even be on different physical disks.
- Logical Volumes (lv): OS will see lvs as partitions. You can format an lv wit your OS and use it.
![pv-vg-lv](https://ping-t.com/mondai3/img/jpg/k34230.jpg)

- fdisk is the main command for viewing / changing and creating<br>
```bash
Command (m for help): m
Command action
   a   toggle a bootable flag
   b   edit bsd disklabel
   c   toggle the dos compatibility flag
   d   delete a partition
   g   create a new empty GPT partition table
   G   create an IRIX (SGI) partition table
   l   list known partition types
   m   print this menu
   n   add a new partition
   o   create a new empty DOS partition table
   p   print the partition table
   q   quit without saving changes
   s   create a new empty Sun disklabel
   t   change a partition's system id
   u   change display/entry units
   v   verify the partition table
   w   write table to disk and exit
   x   extra functionality (experts only)
```

- <b>Primary, Extended & Logical Partitions</b>
<p>The partition table is located in the master boot record (MBR) of a disk. The MBR is the first sector on the disk, so the partition table is not a very large part of it. This limits the primary partitions to 4 and the max size of a disk to around 2TBs. If you need more partitions you have a define one extended and then create logicals inside them.</p>
<p>Linux numbers the primary partitions 1, 2, 3 & 4. If you define an extended partitions, logical partitions inside it will be called 5, 6, 7.</p>
Note: an Extended partition is just an empty box for creating Logical partitions inside it.

```bash
/dev/sda3 is the 3rd primary partition on the first disk
/dev/sdb5 is the first logical partition on the second disk
/dev/sda7 is the 3rd logical partition of the first physical disk
```
![MBR](https://ping-t.com/mondai3/img/jpg/k34058.jpg)

- GPT (GUID Partition Table)
  - 128 primary partitions are available (no need to extended and logical).
  - Maximum storage 9.4ZB. 
  - UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) is needed. 

- SCSI device naming rule
```bash
# SCSI disk number rule
/dev/sda    disk number 1
/dev/sdb    disk number 2
/dev/sdc    disk number 3

# SCSI partition number rule
/dev/sda1   disk number 1, partition number 1
/dev/sdc3   disk number 3, partition number 3
```

- IDE device naming rule
```bash
# IDE disk number rule
/dev/hda    disk number 1
/dev/hdb    disk number 2
/dev/hdc    disk number 3
```

#### # 102.3 Manage shared libraries

Weight: 1

Description: Candidates should be able to determine the shared libraries that executable programs depend on and install them when necessary.

*Key Knowledge Areas:*
- Identify shared libraries.
- Identify the typical locations of system libraries.
- Load shared libraries.

The following is a partial list of the used files, terms and utilities:
- ldd
  - the ldd command helps you find:
    - If a program is dynamically or statically linked
    - What libraries a program needs
    ```bash
    $ ldd /sbin/ldconfig
    not a dynamic executable
    
    $ ldd /bin/ls
    ls     lsblk  lsmod  
    linux-vdso.so.1 =>  (0x00007fffef1fc000)
    libselinux.so.1 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libselinux.so.1 (0x00007f61696b3000)
    libacl.so.1 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libacl.so.1 (0x00007f61694aa000)    
    ```
- Shared library setting: 
  1. Config the library to /etc/ld.so.conf 
  ```bash
  $ vi /etc/ld.so.conf
  /home/test/mylib    --> Add this path as your own lib
  ```
    - Update the setting by executing the `ldconfig` command
    ```bash
    $ ldconfig
    ```
    - ldconfig will update the `/etc/ld.so.cache`
    
  2. Set the library path to LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  - Use this variable if you need to override the original installed libraries and use your own or a specific library. 
    ```bash
    $ export  LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/home/test/mylib
    ```

- Common library directory
```bash
/lib
/lib64
/usr/lib
/usr/lib64
```

*Linking*
1. *Static linking* is when you add this library to your executable program. In this method your program size is big because it has all the needed libraries. One good advantage is your program can be run without being dependent to other programs / libraries.
2. *Dynamic linking* is when you just say in your program "We need this and that library to run this program". This way your program is smaller but you need to install those libraries separately. This makes programs more secure (because libraries can be updated centrally), more advanced (any improvement in a library will improve the whole program) and smaller.

#### # 103.5 Create, monitor and kill processes

Weight: 4

*Description:* Candidates should be able to perform basic process management.

Key Knowledge Areas:
- Run jobs in the foreground and background.
- Signal a program to continue running after logout.
- Monitor active processes.
- Select and sort processes for display.
- Send signals to processes.

The following is a partial list of the used files, terms and utilities:
- &
- bg
- fg
- jobs
- kill
- nohup
- ps
- top
- free
- uptime
- pgrep
- pkill
- killall
- watch
- screen
- tmux

**foreground and background jobs**
![fgbg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fahmifahim/linux-daily/master/images/background_foreground.jpg)

- Normally if you run a program on the terminal, it blocks your terminal but sending a command to the background will prevent this:
```bash
xeyes &
```
- But what if we started it normally? We can break / cancel it with Ctrl+c or suspend it using Ctrl+z.
```bash
$ xeyes 
^Z
[1]+  Stopped                 xeyes

$ jobs
[1]+  Stopped                 xeyes

$ bg
[1]+ xeyes &

$ jobs
[1]+  Running                 xeyes &

$ sleep 1000 & 
[2] 7395

$ jobs
[1]-  Running                 xeyes &
[2]+  Running                 sleep 1000 &

$ fg %2
sleep 1000
^Z
[2]+  Stopped                 sleep 1000

$ jobs
[1]-  Running                 xeyes &
[2]+  Stopped                 sleep 1000

$ bg sle
[2]+ sleep 1000 &

$ jobs
[1]-  Running                 xeyes &
[2]+  Running                 sleep 1000 &
```
> -l switch of jobs will also show the process ID

**nohup**
- The nohup command lets you run your commands even after you logged out and writes its output to nohup.out:
```bash
$ nohup ping 4.2.2.4
nohup: ignoring input and appending output to enohup.outf
^C

$ cat nohup.out 
PING 4.2.2.4 (4.2.2.4) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 4.2.2.4: icmp_seq=1 ttl=51 time=225 ms
64 bytes from 4.2.2.4: icmp_seq=3 ttl=51 time=223 ms

--- 4.2.2.4 ping statistics ---

rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 223.584/224.767/225.950/1.183 ms
```
> It is common to use 2> to redirect the nohup errors to a file: nohup script.sh > mynohup.out 2>&1 &

### # Process
#### # Kill Process
1. kill - terminate a process
</br>You can control processes by using signals. Actually pressing Ctrl+c and Ctrl+z is also sending signals. Another way for this is using the kill command:

[5]-  Running                 sleep 2000 &
[6]+  Running                 sleep 3000 &

$ kill %4

$ jobs
[4]   Terminated              sleep 1000
[5]-  Running                 sleep 2000 &
[6]+  Running                 sleep 3000 &

$ jobs
[5]-  Running                 sleep 2000 &
[6]+  Running                 sleep 3000 &
```
- kill using pid
```bash
$ ps -ef | grep -Ei "ppid|sleep"
UID         PID   PPID  C STIME TTY          TIME CMD
root      10837   9464  0 22:05 pts/0    00:00:00 sleep 2000

[2]-  Terminated              sleep 2000
```

- kill using signal name (pkill = kill using process name)

$ kill -s TERM 10919
$ kill -SIGTERM 10919
$ kill -s SIGTERM 10919

$ pkill -9 sleep        --> kill all sleep process

$ ps -ef | grep -Ei "ppid|sleep"
UID         PID   PPID  C STIME TTY          TIME CMD
root      10920   9464  0 22:18 pts/0    00:00:00 sleep 8000
[5]+  Killed                  sleep 6000
